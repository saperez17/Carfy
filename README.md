# Carfy
Carfy is a project that intends to make cars technical request easier. Similar to how modern ride request apps work, carfy attempts to bring car owners freedom of choice and let them choice their favorite, affordable local automobile service provider.

<p>Branch V2 now contains and up and running <strong>Django+React</strong> version of the App tracked by ther master branch. 
  The frontend folder inside carfy contains, you guessed it, the React frontend code. It still has django-related stuff, mostly for the 
  login and logout which I want to retain to be managed by Django. The React files are located in the src folder.
